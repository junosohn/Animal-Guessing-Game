# Animal-Guessing-Game
This program creates a game in which the computer asks a series of questions in order to guess which animal the user is thinking of. If the computer can't guess, it asks the user for the animal and a question that distinguishes their animal from the last one the computer asked about. The computer then remembers the question and the new animal for the next round.
